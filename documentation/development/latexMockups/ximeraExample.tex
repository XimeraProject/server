\section{What's so Special About \textit{e}?}

I remember the number $e$,
\[
e = 2.718281828459045\dots,
\]
being a very mysterious number. Calculus might be able to help explain
why someone might be interested in this number.

\begin{question}
  Find a function $f(x)$ such that
  \[
  f(0) = 1.
  \]
  \begin{answer}[sage function evaluation]
    \begin{hint}
      What functions do you know? Try evaluating them at zero and see
      if you get $\theanswer{1}$.
    \end{hint}
    $f(x) = 1$
  \end{answer}
